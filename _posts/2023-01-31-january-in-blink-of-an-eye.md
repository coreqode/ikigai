January was a busy month, and many things happened during this period. We submitted one of our works to [SIGGRAPH'23](https://s2023.siggraph.org), which is a good start for this year. I greatly respect SIGGRAPH and SIGGRAPH-Asia community because of the quality of papers published at these conferences. I am not thinking much about acceptance/rejection of our work, as just creating a submission has been rigorous and effortful.

In the last week of January, I traveled to Bengaluru to attend [Research Week With Google](https://sites.google.com/view/researchweek2023/home), which was a good exercise to see all other works differently from my domain. I really liked the talk of [Steven Blackburn](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~steveb/) on `Garbage Collector.` Given I had zero experience in the Garbage Collector, it was a pretty educational talk, and I learned a lot about the current research trends there. Though, it was hard for me to connect with others either because of no overlap of the research domain or because of my introverted and shy nature. After traveling to Bengaluru, I have been ill as well. Most probably, it is just viral (sore throat and fever), which canceled my plans to travel to [Pondicherry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pondicherry) as well. :(

The next few months will also be busy because of so many exciting research threads and deadlines. Let's see how it goes!!!

Adios!!
