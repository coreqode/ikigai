So, January was a pretty busy month and a lot of things happened in this period. We submitted one of our work to [SIGGRAPH'23](https://s2023.siggraph.org) which is a pretty good start for this year. I have a huge respect to SIGGRAPH and SIGGRAPH-Asia community because of the quality of papers published in these conferences. I am not thinking much about acceptance/rejection of the our work, as just creating submission has been pretty rigorous and effortful.


In the last week of January, I travelled to Bengaluru to attend [Reseach Week With Google](https://sites.google.com/view/researchweek2023/home) which was a pretty good exercise to see all other works different than my domain. I really liked the talk of [Steven Blackburn](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~steveb/) on `Garbage Collector`. Given I had zero experience in the Garbage Collector, it was pretty educational talk and came to know a lot about the current research trends there. Though, it was pretty hard for me to connect with others either because of no overlap of research domain or because of my introvert and shy nature. After travelling to Bengaluru, I have been ill as well. Most probably, it is just viral (sore throat and fever), which cancelled my plans to travel [Pondicherry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pondicherry) as well. :(
