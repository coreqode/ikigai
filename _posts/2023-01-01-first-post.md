Disclaimer: I am not good at writing and often don't care about grammar.

I plan to start something new this new year with this blog post. Though I am unsure how consistent I can be in future, this blog will be soups of my experiences in the parallel universes of academic research, music, and travel. I also maintain another blog [Connected Maths](/connected-maths/) where I connect dots in mathematics to gain insights that can be used in my research.

Let's see how it goes.
Stay Tuned!
